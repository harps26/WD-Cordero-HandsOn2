What is the project?

The project is a website featuring 5 different hero designs, each represented by a static card and an animated card. These designs are unique in their visual presentation and animation styles, showcasing various fictional heroes or characters.

- Animated Cards: Animated cards showcase dynamic animations related to each hero, enhancing user engagement and visual appeal.
- Navigation: Navigation elements allow users to explore different heroes and their respective static and animated cards.
- Responsive Design: The website is responsive to ensure usability across various devices and screen sizes.

- CSS: Used for styling the website, including layout, colors, fonts, animations, and responsive design techniques.

Specific Uses of Technology:
- Selectors and Styling: CSS selectors are used to target HTML elements and apply styles such as colors, fonts, margins, paddings, and borders to create visually appealing hero cards.

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.

```
